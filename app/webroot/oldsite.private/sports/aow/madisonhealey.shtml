                    <p class="greyhHeader">The Arena Club would like to congratulate Bel Air High School's Madison Healey as this weeks Athlete of the Week.<br />
                      <br />
                      <span class="bodytext">Madison is a WTF certified first degree black belt. She trains at US Taekwondo Academy where she takes traditional taekwondo classes. In addition, Madison was invited to try out and was accepted onto their elite competition team, Team Chang (they have a JV and Varsity level and Madison is on Varsity). She competes at the local, state and national level. Madison won the silver medal sparring at the 2012 USA Taekwondo National Championships in Dallas, Texas. Placing at Nationals is thought of by many as the highest achievement, next to World Games and Olympics. Madison also plays field hockey for BAHS under Coach Phyllis Hemmes. Madison was captain of her junior varsity team as a sophomore and will most likely follow suit next year as a senior (she is currently a junior). She made the All County Field Hockey Team this year. Madison was the only Junior this year to start every single game and was kept in for the entire game (unless she called herself out or was injured-Madison did have a sprained ankle for a small portion of the season). Madison's dedication, heart and drive are admirable and an inspiration.<br />
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Madison is a part of the biomedical sciences program at BAHS where she takes Honors and AP classes. She has a p/t job with Rita's Italian Ice. She also has volunteered for the community through various youth group activities (such as serving at a local soup kitchen, The Sharing Table; day mission trips; has done Christmas Caroling to shut-ins; collected, packed, and delivered food to the needy etc... to name a few. Madison was a Girl Scout until age 13 and did various community service projects through them as well.</span></p>
