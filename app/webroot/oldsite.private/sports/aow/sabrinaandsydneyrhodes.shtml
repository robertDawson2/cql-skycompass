                    <p class="bodytext">Sydney and Sabrina Rhodes are twins sophomores who have helped C Milton Wright Field Hockey to a 6-0 UCBAC record; 12-2 overall record this season. Despite being twins both girls play different roles in helping CMW to the #15 ranking in the recent Baltimore Metro poll. Sabrina is the leading scorer on CMW Varsity FH team; 10 goals and 7 assists. She also had the game winning assist against Fallston; game winning goal against Patterson Mill. Sydney plays on the defensive side of the field and is the starting goalie. She has only allowed 3 goals in league play including shut out in clinching game versus North Harford; only 9 goals allowed in 14 games (started all 14). He save percentage is a incredible 88%. These twins are great athletes on and off the field excelling in the classroom with GPA's above 3.5. Congrats on being the definition of great STUDENT ATHLETES and helping your team this 2012 season. Good Luck in the 3A playoffs Sydney and Sabrina</p>
