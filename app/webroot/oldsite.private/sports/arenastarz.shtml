                    <p class="bodytext">What started out as the brand for our elite baseball program in  Harford County, The Arena Starz name has now been extended to include a club  soccer program and a year-round swim team.</p>
                    <p class="bodytext">Starz Baseball provides an academy-style baseball experience,  combining consistent, competitive team play with high caliber coaching and  training designed to produce well-prepared high school athletes and beyond.  This goal has been extended to the Starz Soccer Club—a year-round soccer club  program, currently consisting of five teams; and Arena Starz Swimming —a  year-round competitive swim team that competes in the Maryland LSC ofUSA  swimming.</p>
                    <p class="bodytext">The Arena Starz sports programs are modeled after the success of  pro and college teams. Technical and tactical coaching comes from professional  and certified coaches for the players&rsquo; development in their sports. Starz  players also benefit from strength and conditioning training that is specific  to their sport. The addition of this type of training takes teams and athletes to  a new level. Training focus is not only on increasing performance, but on  prevention of injury as well.</p>
                    <p class="bodytext">The Arena Starz have access to some of the best facilities in the  area between The Arena Club and The Arena Club Sports Academy. We are set apart  from other teams because we offer indoor and outdoor practice times to develop  skill sets in each athlete. We have professional scouts and agents on our<br />
                      coaching staff that are experienced in recruiting for college teams  and have trained at the professional level.</p>
                    <p class="bodytext">Choosing The Arena Starz means committing to a successful, proven  program. We are anticipating a great season for all of our Starz teams and are  excited about the expansion of the Starz brand in the future.</p>
