                    <p class="subheader"><span class="bodytext">Coach Mezzanotte has been involved with lacrosse since 1977 when the Board of Education in Harford County, Maryland approved the inclusion of lacrosse into the interscholastic sports venue. In his 35+ years of coaching experience which included recreation, high school, college and the professional ranks he has always brought his enthusiasm and knowledge at every level.  He  also co-founded Harford Lacrosse Camp which has been running strong 30+ years for boys and girls ages 5-18. Coach Mezzanotte is also proud to boast of his teaching career which spans 35 plus years.  He is a certified K-12 teacher and has taught at every level with elementary being his favorite age level.  <br />

                    <p class="subheader"><span class="greyhHeader">Coach Mezzanotte's Philosophy</span><span class="bodytext"><br />
                      “Every kid counts.&quot;  He likes to work with each kid individually to  improve their weaknesses and build confidence through their strengths. </span></p>
                    <p class="subheader"><span class="bodytext">The Lax Starz Academy is a great program for players of all abilities.  Coach Mezzanotte focuses on repetition of fundamentals, which are needed to have success at higher levels of lacrosse.  Most college coaches are not impressed with the “razzle, dazzle stuff” but want kids to come into a college setting with the proper fundamentals to succeed.  The Lax Starz Academy has  an onsite sport performance trainer during  strength and conditioning.  We use  state-of-the-art technology through sports cords, dynamic warm-ups, reaction drills, and more to prepare your player for their upcoming season.</span></p>

                    “We love Coach Mezz!  He makes a great effort to know each boy individually and make individual suggestions to improve their game.”<br />
                    </span><span class="bodytext"><br />
                      “I have never seen my son work so hard, learn so much, and have so much fun doing anything.  Coach Mezz spoke to the boys with respect, gave constructive criticism, and encouragement.”<br />
                      <br />
                      “I have told everyone that will listen, that this is the best money you can spend for your son to learn to play lacrosse the right way.”<br />
                      <br />
                      “Coach Mezz never brings ego to the field.  He treats every boy the same no matter what the skill level.”</span></p>
                    <p class="bodytext">&quot;Coach Frank, My son Paul is a junior at Fallston High School. After not making the cut freshmen year, he trained with you last year during your Sunday sessions just prior to try-outs and made the JV Lacrosse team. There is little doubt in my mind that it was the time he spent with you that made the difference. Thank you.&quot;</p>
