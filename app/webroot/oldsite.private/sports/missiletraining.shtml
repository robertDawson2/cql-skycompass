                    <p class="bodytext"><span class="greyhHeader">Missile Training</span> is built on the premise that “Form Dictates Function,” therefore proper form dictates a more consistent performance. Through specific protocols, Missile Training targets weaknesses in the athletes movements that can restrict proper athletic performance. The design of Missile Training is to limit the compensations of the muscular skeletal system so that an athlete’s body is able to endure higher levels of training and excel in real time game play. Missile Training protocols will teach the athlete’s nervous system how to properly power on and power off at will, which will increase the harmony of muscle movement within their body. Missile Training added to any traditional sports training program is guaranteed to make an athlete stronger, more powerful, have i<span class="bodytext">ncreased velocity, an explosive first step quickness, greater lateral agility, and maximize balance and coordination. <br />
