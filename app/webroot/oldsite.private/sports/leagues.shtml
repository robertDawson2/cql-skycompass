                    <p class="bodytext">Grains of rubber subsurface and synthetic field grass ease the impact on your pre and post season play. Our field simulates a perfectly natural grass surface. Our premier rubber infill surface allows players to increase speed and performance and enhance their stability, speed, and traction. The sidelines are not bound by walls, but instead the freedom of netting creates a more realistic barrier which allows teams to maximize their outdoor game.</p>
