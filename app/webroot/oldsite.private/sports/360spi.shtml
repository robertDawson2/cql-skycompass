                    <p class="greyhHeader">There’s a new excitement building up at The Arena Club...and the year is only just beginning.  Our passion for sports training has elevated<span class="greyhHeader"> to a new level with our new 360 Sports Performance Institute (S.P.I.).</span></p>
                    <p class="bodytext">360SPI was developed with the concept of offering athletes a complete 360 degree package of services  so they can develop to their full potential—all under one roof.  From the beginner player all the way to college-level athlete, the 360 Sports Performance Institute offers athletes cutting edge sports performance training to meet the high demand needs for any sport.  Our highly trained and certified 360SPI team tailors training programs to an athlete’s specific needs and works to develop the “complete student athlete,” starting with a solid foundation. </p>
                    <p class="bodytext">Services at the 360 Sports Performance Institute include Super Bowl Champion and former Baltimore Raven, Qadry Ismail’s, “Missile Training” for athletes to build strong foundation; Movement, Overspeed, Resistance, Reaction (MORR) training for more focused training; sport-specific instruction;  physical therapy; and academic counseling and college recruiting services. “Our institute has something for everyone.  Whether a child is just starting out in recreation sports or moving towards advanced-level playing, our Sports Institute is equipped to help athletes make improvements in both their physical and mental game,” shared 360SPI Coordinator, Bill Ackerman.</p>
                    <p class="bodytext">Ackerman leads a team of highly educated sports trainers who carry degrees as well as specialized sports training certifications from NSPA, NASM, Nike SPARQ, MORR, CSPS and more.  Qadry Ismail’s Missile Training adds another level of experience and services to the team.  “Qadry’s multi-sport achievements and experience at the professional level bring an entirely new dimension to our training services,” said Ackerman.<br />
                    </p>
                    <p class="greyhHeader">The Arena Club’s 360 Sports Performance Institute currently offers the following programs:<span class="bodytext"></span></p>
                    <p class="bodytext"><span class="greyhHeader">Missile Training w/Qadry Ismail</span><br />
                      Missile Training is built on the premise that “Form Dictates Function,” therefore proper form dictates a more consistent performance. Through specific protocols, Missile Training targets weaknesses in the athletes movements that can restrict proper athletic performance. The design of Missile Training is to limit the compensations of the muscular skeletal system so that an athlete’s body is able to endure higher levels of training and excel in real time game play. Missile Training protocols will teach the athlete’s nervous system how to properly power on and power off at will, which will increase the harmony of muscle movement within their body. Missile Training added to any traditional sports training program is guaranteed to make an athlete stronger, more powerful, have increased velocity, an explosive first step quickness, greater lateral agility, and maximize balance and coordination. </p>
                    <p class="bodytext"><span class="greyhHeader">M.O.R.R. Movement Training </span><br />
                      Movement Overspeed Resistance Reaction is a training system that  provides our athletes a revolutionary approach to developing movement.  We are able to provide our athletes the opportunity to train in 360 degrees of movement increasing their speed, agility, quickness and creating complete athleticism. <br />
                    </p>
                    <p class="bodytext"><span class="greyhHeader">Sports Specific Training</span><br />
                      Whether its learning sport-specific lifts in the weight room, developing proper fundamentals in a sport on the turf field or having a nutritional consultation to discuss proper performance nutrition for student athletes, the S.P.I. team can provide it all at one location. This training is focused and designed to meet an athlete’s specific needs in his or her sport.  Our expert staff designs programs and drills that are sport and position specific for athletes of all levels and ages. A nationally recognized sports nutritionist can design athlete specific meal plans, upon request. <br />
