                    <p class="purplehHeader"><strong>What is Thin&amp;Healthy&rsquo;s Total Solution?</strong></p>
                    <p class="bodytext">The answer is simple. </p>
                    <p class="bodytext"><strong>Thin&amp;Healthy&rsquo;s Total Solution is your LAST STOP for weight loss! We exist to teach you a healthy lifestyle so you&rsquo;ll never need to lose weight again!</strong></p>
                    <p class="bodytext"><strong>Thin and Healthy is unlike any other weight loss program because it&rsquo;s designed specifically around you as an individual. </strong></p>
                    <p class="bodytext">Unlike other one-size-fits-all dieting and weight loss approaches, Thin &amp; Healthy focuses on finding the right solution that works with YOU and with YOUR lifestyle. </p>
                    <p class="bodytext">Thin &amp; Healthy is <strong>NOT a &ldquo;Diet&rdquo;</strong>. Diets don&rsquo;t work because they&rsquo;re not a long-term solution. And, permanent weight loss is <strong>NOT ABOUT THE FOOD</strong>. The secret to losing weight and keeping it off is actually about a balanced lifestyle that incorporates the things you love to eat with daily movement and proper motivation. That&rsquo;s why our program incorporates your 20 favorite foods, uses real grocery store foods, includes simple, easy and fun ways to move, and provides you with a vast motivation and support system. </p>
                    <h3 class="purplehHeader" id="toc-why-dieting-doesnt-work">Why Dieting Doesn&rsquo;t work.</h3>
                    <p class="bodytext">Thin&amp;Healthy is not a diet. It&rsquo;s a lifestyle that teaches you how to make healthy choices that you enjoy. </p>
                    <p class="bodytext">We know there are thousands of &lsquo;diets&rsquo; on the market for you to choose from. In fact the average American has been on 10-20 diets in the last 3.5-5 years!</p>
                    <p class="bodytext"><strong><em>Aren&rsquo;t you tired of trying all of these &lsquo;diets&rsquo; and not getting to and staying where you want to be?</em></strong></p>
                    <p class="bodytext">Now, imagine feeling great about your weight, your body, and your health.  That&rsquo;s Thin  &amp; Healthy&rsquo;s Total Solution. </p>
                    <p class="bodytext">How do you feel right now (as you sit at your computer) about your weight, your body, and your health? </p>
                    <p class="bodytext">You&rsquo;d like it to be better but you&rsquo;re tired of trying all the gimmicks and diets that haven&rsquo;t worked for you right? </p>
                    <p class="bodytext">Finally, you no longer have to settle for just part of the solution…now you can have the <strong>TOTAL SOLUTION and never need to lose weight again!</strong></p>
                    <p class="bodytext">With Thin &amp; Healthy&rsquo;s Total Solution, you&rsquo;ll never feel like your alone in your effort.

                    <p class="bodytext">The Thin&amp;Healthy program focuses on 3 core areas which include:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li class="bodytext">Weight Loss</li>
                      <li class="bodytext">Movement </li>
                      <li class="bodytext">Life Success/Motivation </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="bodytext">The appropriate balance between these core areas will result in developing not only the body you desire, but self-confidence and personal development as well. </p>
