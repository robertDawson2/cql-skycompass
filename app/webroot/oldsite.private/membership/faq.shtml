                    <p class="bodytext">We offer a one-year membership for several reasons.  We realize that fitness is a way of life and not a quick fix.   If you are serious about improving the quality of your life, then working out will need to become a part of your day-to-day routine.  Most people can&rsquo;t accomplish their goals in less than 12 months. We are here to make sure that you are successful.  As a member, you will appreciate the fact that we do not offer short-term memberships.  Our policy is the main reason why our pools are not so crowded in the summer.  We realize that being a member is a privilege and that we want to protect the integrity of your club.</p>
