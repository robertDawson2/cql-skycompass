                    <p class="bodytext">The Childcare staff at The Arena Club will provide a loving and caring environment with age appropriate activities for your child. When you leave your child with our staff, we want you to have complete peace of mind, and we have invested in the best security equipment to ensure your child&rsquo;s well being and safety.  Parents are required to use their Arena Club ID card to check their child in upon arrival and out with each departure.  We also ask that you sign in/out as well as give your location within the club to help the staff locate you should your child need parental attention. In addition to keeping your child safe, the childcare team will strive to provide a clean environment for the children by completing daily checklists and following the guidelines of the sick policy provided by management.</p>

                    <p class="bodytext">Childcare is included in your family membership for children ages 6 weeks to 11 years old.  Nursery visits FOR children walking and older are limited to two hours per child per day; infants are allowed one and a half hours per day.  Any child who is not yet walking will be included in the infant category and is required to have a reservation.  Infants will not be accepted into childcare without a reservation.  Reservations must be made at least 24 hours in advance and not more than 72 hours in advance.  We ask that all cancellations be made at least 12 hours in advance.  Parents are required to remain on club premises at all times while children are in the club&rsquo;s care.   No food or bottle-feeding is permitted in childcare, only sippy cups with water or juice will be allowed.  Cubbies are provided in childcare for parents to store diaper bags, coats, etc.  Childcare staff is not responsible for any lost items stored in this area.  No diapering services are provided. Team members will make every effort to find a parent in the facility if a child becomes upset for an extended period of time. The club reserves the right to refuse to accept children who are continually unruly or disruptive.</p>
                    <p class="bodytext"><br />
                      The Arena Club takes the security of children very seriously. In order to protect them, we will not release a child to anyone else but the parent or designated guardian who brought them into the nursery without written and signed authorization.</p>
