                    </p>
                    <p class="bodytext">We know that there are a lot of questions you may have before you're ready to work with a Personal Trainer. Here are some commonly asked questions and our answers for you. Of course if you have any other questions or concerns please feel free to ask any trainer at the club or email Training Director,<a href="mailto: nbosleysmith@thearenaclub.com"> Nicole Bosley-Smith.</a></p>
                    <p class="bodytext"><span class="greyhHeader">Is personal training affordable? 
                      Can it fit into my budget?</span><br />
                      Personal Training is affordable when you consider the lifestyle changes you will be making to embark on a healthier life.  We are able to tailor our payment plans to meet your monthly budget restrictions in most cases.  Just present to your trainer your needs and we are happy to work with you in any way we can.</p>
                    <p class="bodytext"><span class="greyhHeader">How do I know which trainer to choose?</span><br />
                      All of the trainers at The Arena Club are certified.  We present their backgrounds and bios on the trainers wall on the fitness floor for you to also find the best match for your needs.  Another productive way to select a trainer is to observe the trainer in action with another client.  Matching goals and personalities are the most important points in picking the right trainer.  We want you to be confident in the trainer that you select and we will help match you with the best fit.</p>
                    <p class="bodytext"><span class="greyhHeader">Do I have to give personal information                      such as weight and measurements?</span><br />
                      You are not required to give weight and measurements to our trainers.  However this can be a terrific motivator when you are able to track your success.</p>
                    <p class="bodytext"><span class="greyhHeader">How will I know what to do when I'm done training?</span><br />
                      You will be loaded with a new element of knowledge that you did not have prior to Personal Training.  This will enable you to move forward with your new healthier you with a new confidence and motivation.  You will feel confident that you have a proven road map to continue to achieve your goals. </p>
                    <p class="bodytext"><span class="greyhHeader">How long are the sessions?</span><br />
                      Our Personal Training sessions are held in 30 or 60 minute sessions.</p>
                    <p class="bodytext"><span class="greyhHeader">How soon will I see results?</span><br />
                      You will see results with the proper commitment to nutrition and exercise in 4-6 weeks on average.  The timing of success is based on your commitment to a healthier lifestyle.  </p>
                    <p class="bodytext"><span class="greyhHeader">Can I do group training?</span><br />
                      We do offer group training.  Many find this to be motivating and inspiring to perform training with a friend or family member. </p>
