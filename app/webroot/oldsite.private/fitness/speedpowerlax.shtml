  His philosophy is that “Every Kids counts”.  His likes to worked with each kid individually to and improve their weaknesses and build confidence through their strengths. The Lax Starz Academy is a great program for players of all abilities.  Coach Mezzanotte focuses on repetition of fundamentals, which are needed to have success at higher levels of lacrosse.  Most college coaches are not impressed with the “razzle, dazzle stuff” but want kids to come into a college setting with the proper fundamentals to succeed.  The Lax Starz Academy has also an onsite sport performance trainer during their strength and conditioning.  We used the state of the art technology through sports cords, dynamic warm-ups, reaction drills, etc. to prepare your player for their upcoming season.<br />
  <br />
  “We love Coach Mezz!  He makes a great effort to know each boy individually and make individual suggestions to improve their game.”<br />
  “I have never seen my son work so hard, learn so much, and have so much fun doing anything.  Coach Mezz spoke to the boys with respect, gave constructive criticism, and encouragement.”<br />
  <br />
  “I have told everyone that will listen, that this is the best money you can spend for your son to learn to play lacrosse the right way.”<br />
  “Coach Mezz never brings ego to the field.  He treats every boy the same no matter what the skill level.”</p>
